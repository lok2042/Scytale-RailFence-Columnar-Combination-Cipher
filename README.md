# Scytale-RailFence-Columnar-Combination-Cipher
Scytale-RailFence-Columnar Combination Cipher is a command-line Python program that performs encryption and decryption using three back-to-back cipher operations: Scytale, Rail Fence, and Columnar. The program ensures a highly secure ciphertext by using two keys, an integer key for Scytale and Rail Fence, and a string key for Columnar Cipher.
